## General info
This project is a simple quiz application used for me to learn about implementing javascript functions. The focus of this project was on improving Javascript skills. As a result the styling of this program is relatively basic. 
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* HTML 5
* CSS
* Javascript (Vanilla)
	
## Quiz Guidelines
* The quiz is timed (60 seconds).
* Your score is the amount of time you have left (higher is 'better')
* For incorrect answers you will be deducted 10 seconds from your remaining time (and hence score)
* Your score will be stored in a 'top-scores' list with your name (as you enter it) if you are in the top 5 scorers. 
* Scores are initiated on local storage so will be automatically filled with zero values and 'none' players on your first play.
